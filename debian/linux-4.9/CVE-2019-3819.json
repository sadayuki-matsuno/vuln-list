  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read() in drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user (\"root\") can cause a system lock up and a denial of service. Versions from v4.18 and newer are vulnerable.",
