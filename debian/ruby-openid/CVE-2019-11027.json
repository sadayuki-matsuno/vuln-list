  "description": "Ruby OpenID (aka ruby-openid) through 2.8.0 has a remotely exploitable flaw. This library is used by Rails web applications to integrate with OpenID Providers. Severity can range from medium to critical, depending on how a web application developer chose to employ the ruby-openid library. Developers who based their OpenID integration heavily on the \"example app\" provided by the project are at highest risk.",
