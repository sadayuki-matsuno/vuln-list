  "description": "Bip before 0.8.9, when running as a daemon, writes SSL handshake errors to an unexpected file descriptor that was previously associated with stderr before stderr has been closed, which allows remote attackers to write to other sockets and have an unspecified impact via a failed SSL handshake, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5268. NOTE: some sources originally mapped this CVE to two different types of issues; this CVE has since been SPLIT, producing CVE-2011-5268.",
