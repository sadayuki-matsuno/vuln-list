  "description": "Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in SUSE Linux 9.3 and 10.0, and possibly other distributions, cause the working directory to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via (1) beagle, (2) tomboy, or (3) blam.  NOTE: in August 2007, the tomboy vector was reported for other distributions.",
