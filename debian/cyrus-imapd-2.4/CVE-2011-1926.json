  "description": "The STARTTLS implementation in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.7 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a \"plaintext command injection\" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.",
