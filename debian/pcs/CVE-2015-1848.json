  "description": "The pcs daemon (pcsd) in PCS 0.9.137 and earlier does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. CVE-2015-3983 is for the issue with not setting the HTTPOnly flag.",
