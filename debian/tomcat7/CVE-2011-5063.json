  "description": "The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check realm values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the availability of a protection space with weaker authentication or authorization requirements, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.",
