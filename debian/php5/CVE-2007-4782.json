  "description": "PHP before 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the pattern parameter to the glob function; or (2) a long string in the string parameter to the fnmatch function, accompanied by a pattern parameter value with undefined characteristics, as demonstrated by a \"*[1]e\" value.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.",
