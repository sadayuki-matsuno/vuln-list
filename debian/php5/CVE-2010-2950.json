  "description": "Format string vulnerability in stream.c in the phar extension in PHP 5.3.x through 5.3.3 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted phar:// URI that is not properly handled by the phar_stream_flush function, leading to errors in the php_stream_wrapper_log_error function.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-2094.",
