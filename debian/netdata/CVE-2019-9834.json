  "description": "** DISPUTED ** The Netdata web application through 1.13.0 allows remote attackers to inject their own malicious HTML code into an imported snapshot, aka HTML Injection. Successful exploitation will allow attacker-supplied HTML to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. NOTE: the vendor disputes the risk because there is a clear warning next to the button for importing a snapshot.",
