  "description": "A vulnerability exists in the Windows sandbox where an uninitialized value in memory can be leaked to a renderer from a broker when making a call to access an otherwise unavailable file. This results in the potential leaking of information stored at that memory location. *Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60.7, Firefox \u003c 67, and Firefox ESR \u003c 60.7.",
