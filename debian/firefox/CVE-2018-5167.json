  "description": "The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display \"chrome:\" links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display \"javascript:\" links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 60.",
