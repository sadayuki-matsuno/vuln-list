  "description": "Under certain circumstances the \"fetch()\" API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a \"no-store\" or \"no-cache\" cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 52.7 and Firefox \u003c 59.",
