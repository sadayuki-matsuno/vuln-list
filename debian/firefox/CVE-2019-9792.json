  "description": "The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60.6, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.6, and Firefox \u003c 66.",
