This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash. Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 52.5.2, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.5.2, and Firefox \u003c 57.0.2.",
