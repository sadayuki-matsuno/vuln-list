  "description": "The Firefox installer on Windows can be made to load malicious DLL files stored in the same directory as the installer when it is run. This allows privileged execution if the installer is run with elevated privileges. Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 54, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 52.2.",
