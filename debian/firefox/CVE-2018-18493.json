  "description": "A buffer overflow can occur in the Skia library during buffer offset calculations with hardware accelerated canvas 2D actions due to the use of 32-bit calculations instead of 64-bit. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60.4, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.4, and Firefox \u003c 64.",
