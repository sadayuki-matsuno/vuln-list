  "description": "NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60, Thunderbird \u003c 52.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.1, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.9, and Firefox \u003c 61.",
