  "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when script uses mutation events to move DOM nodes between documents, resulting in the old document that held the node being freed but the node still having a pointer referencing it. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60, Thunderbird \u003c 52.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.1, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.9, and Firefox \u003c 61.",
