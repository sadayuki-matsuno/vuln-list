  "description": "The jpeg2000_read_main_headers function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c in FFmpeg before 2.6.5, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, and 2.8.x through 2.8.2 does not enforce uniqueness of the SIZ marker in a JPEG 2000 image, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap-memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image with two or more of these markers.",
