  "description": "The iff_read_header function in iff.c in libavformat in FFmpeg through 1.1.3 does not properly handle data sizes for Interchange File Format (IFF) data during operations involving a CMAP chunk or a video codec, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds array access, and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted header.",
