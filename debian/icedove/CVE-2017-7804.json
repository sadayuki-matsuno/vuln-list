  "description": "The destructor function for the \"WindowsDllDetourPatcher\" class can be re-purposed by malicious code in concert with another vulnerability to write arbitrary data to an attacker controlled location in memory. This can be used to bypass existing memory protections in this situation. Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 52.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.3, and Firefox \u003c 55.",
