  "description": "Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 52, Firefox ESR \u003c 45.8, Thunderbird \u003c 52, and Thunderbird \u003c 45.8.",
