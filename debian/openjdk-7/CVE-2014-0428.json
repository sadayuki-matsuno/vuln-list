  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u55, 6u65, and 7u45; Java SE Embedded 7u45; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to CORBA.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is related to \"insufficient security checks in IIOP streams,\" which allows attackers to escape the sandbox.",
