  "description": "Oracle Java SE 7 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7 and earlier, computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash3 algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2739.",
