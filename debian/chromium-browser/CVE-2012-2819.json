  "description": "The texSubImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not properly handle uploads to floating-point textures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web page, as demonstrated by certain WebGL performance tests, aka rdar problem 11520387.",
