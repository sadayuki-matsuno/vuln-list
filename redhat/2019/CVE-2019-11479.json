    "\nJonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363.\n    ",
    "\nAn excessive resource consumption flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP segments. If the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of a TCP connection was set to low values, such as 48 bytes, it can leave as little as 8 bytes for the user data, which significantly increases the Linux kernel's resource (CPU, Memory, and Bandwidth) utilization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (DoS) by repeatedly sending network traffic on a TCP connection with low TCP MSS.\n    "
