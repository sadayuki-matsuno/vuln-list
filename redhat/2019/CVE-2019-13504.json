    "\nA vulnerability was found in exiv2. An integer wraparound could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way MemIo is implemented. Reading from the memory buffer with MemIo::Impl::read() reads data beyond the bufferâ€™s limits. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image that when read, would cause the application to crash or to leak sensitive data.\n    "
