    "\nA flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module while connecting to a malicious wireless network.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Marvell wifi chip driver. A heap overflow in mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in marvell/mwifiex/scan.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThis flaw requires a system with marvell wifi network card to be attempting to connect to a attacker controlled wifi network.  A temporary mitigation may be to only connect to known-good networks via wifi, or connect to a network via ethernet.  Alternatively if wireless networking is not used the mwifiex kernel module can be blacklisted to prevent misuse of the vulnerable code.\n    ",
