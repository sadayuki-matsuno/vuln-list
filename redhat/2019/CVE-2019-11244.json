  "details": [
    "\nIn Kubernetes v1.8.x-v1.14.x, schema info is cached by kubectl in the location specified by --cache-dir (defaulting to $HOME/.kube/http-cache), written with world-writeable permissions (rw-rw-rw-). If --cache-dir is specified and pointed at a different location accessible to other users/groups, the written files may be modified by other users/groups and disrupt the kubectl invocation.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in kubectl that leaves http-cache files with read/write permissions for any user. In conjunction with a non-default value for --cache-dir, this may lead to the cache content being placed in a location accessible to other users on the system.\n    "
