  "details": [
    "\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) technology. A firmware identifier string is duplicated with the kstrdup function, and the allocation may fail under very low memory conditions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by causing a Denial of Service and crashing the system.\n    "
