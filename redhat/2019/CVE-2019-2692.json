  "statement": "\nRed Hat Satellite does not support using mysql as a back end database, thus the mysql connector is not used in any Satellite installation.\n\nThe package mariadb Java client is now available in Red Hat Software Collections.  It can be installed this way:\n\n  # yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms\n  # yum install rh-mariadb103-mariadb-java-client\n\nThis JDBC driver works fine with both, MariaDB and MySQL servers.  We recommend use of mariadb-java-client over mysql-java-connector where possible.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate.
