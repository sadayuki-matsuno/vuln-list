  "statement": "\nThis bind flaw can be exploited by a remote attacker (AV:N). However the attack works only if the attacker could cause the bind server to perform queries on another DNS server and the other DNS server deliberately responds with malformed answers (AC:H). No other special privileges are required by the attacker (PR:L). No user interaction is required from the server side (UI:N). The attacker can cause denial of service (A:H) by causing the named process to exit with an assertion flaw. There is no affect on the Confidentiality or Integrity of the system (C:N/I:N).\n    ",
