    "\nip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment.\n    ",
    "\nA heap buffer overflow issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs in the ip_reass() routine while reassembling incoming packets if the first fragment is bigger than the m-\u003em_dat[] buffer. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a Denial of Service or potentially executing arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.\n    "
