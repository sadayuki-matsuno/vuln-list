  "details": [
    "\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c does not validate the sect and head fields, as demonstrated by an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user when a floppy disk has been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s floppy disk driver implementation. A local attacker with access to the floppy device could call set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c, which does not validate the sect and head fields, causing an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. This flaw may crash the system or allow an attacker to gather information causing subsequent successful attacks.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThe kernel module named 'floppy' contains the affected code, this can be blacklisted using the standard blacklisting techniques or disabled in the systems BIOS.  See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for how to blacklist a kernel module.\n\nVirtualized guest systems can also remove the system from the guests configuration to ensure that the module does not load.\n    ",
