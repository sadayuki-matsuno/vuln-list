    "\nImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer overflow at MagickCore/statistic.c in EvaluateImages because of mishandling columns.\n    ",
    "\nA heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it applies a value with arithmetic, relational, or logical operators to an image due to mishandling columns. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images and use the evaluate-sequence option or function EvaluateImages may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or potentially execute code.\n    "
