    "\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick version 7.0.8-50 Q16, containing memory leaks of AcquireMagickMemory due to an error found in MagickWand/mogrify.c. It was discovered that ImageMagick does not properly release acquired memory when some error conditions occur in the function MogrifyImageList(). Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images may be exploited to use all available memory and make them crash. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image and cause a Denial of Service by using all available memory.\n    "
