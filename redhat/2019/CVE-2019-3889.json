  "statement": "\nSince the HTTP Response \"Content Type\" is \"text/plain\" most browsers won't execute any Javascipt in the response content. However if an attacker can trick a user into loading the response in an iFrame it is possible to exploit this vulnerability. Appropriate Cross Origin Resource (CORS) Allowed Domain configuration in OCP 3 should prevent an attacker from getting any response from a attacker hosted domain. Therefore make sure that corsAllowedDomains is specified correctly in your OCP 3 master-config.yaml.
