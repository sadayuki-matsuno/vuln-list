    "\nAn issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.22, 2.1 before 2.1.10, and 2.2 before 2.2.3. An HTTP request is not redirected to HTTPS when the SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT settings are used, and the proxy connects to Django via HTTPS. In other words, django.http.HttpRequest.scheme has incorrect behavior when a client uses HTTP.\n    ",
    "\nAn HTTP detection flaw was discovered in Django.  If deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS,  django.http.HttpRequest.scheme() incorrectly detected client requests made using HTTP as using HTTPS.  This resulted in incorrect results for is_secure() and build_absolute_uri(), and HTTP requests were not correctly redirected to HTTPS in accordance with SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT.\n    "
