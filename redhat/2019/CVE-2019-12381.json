    "\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: this is disputed because new_ra is never used if it is NULL.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel that allows an attacker to crash a system under low-memory free conditions in the ipv4 router advertisement code. The attacker must be able to send 'router advertisements' which limits the attack vector to be on the same physical segment.\n    "
