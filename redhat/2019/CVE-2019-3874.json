    "\nThe SCTP socket buffer used by a userspace application is not accounted by the cgroups subsystem. An attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack. Kernel 3.10.x and 4.18.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.\n    ",

  "mitigation": "\nSELinux prevents a bind of the SCTP socket by a non-root user. \n\nTo mitigate this issue if not using SELinux, or if a Security Context Constraint allows running pods as the root user the 'sctp' module should be blacklisted.
