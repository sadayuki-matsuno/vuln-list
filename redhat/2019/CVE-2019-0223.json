  "details": [
    "\nWhile investigating bug PROTON-2014, we discovered that under some circumstances Apache Qpid Proton versions 0.9 to 0.27.0 (C library and its language bindings) can connect to a peer anonymously using TLS *even when configured to verify the peer certificate* while used with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0. This means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange to intercept TLS traffic.\n    ",
    "\nA cryptographic weakness was discovered in qpid-proton's use of TLS. If the qpid-proton client was used without client certificates, it would accept an anonymous cipher offered by the server. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to silently intercept traffic that should have been encrypted.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThis attack will not work if client-certificate authentication is in place because anonymous ciphers would not then be available.\nAnother possible mitigation is to disable anonymous ciphers on clients.\n    ",
