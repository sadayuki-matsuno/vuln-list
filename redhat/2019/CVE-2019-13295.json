    "\nA heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it selects an individual threshold for each pixel based on the range of intensity values in its local neighborhood due to a width of zero mishandle error. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or leak application data.\n    "
