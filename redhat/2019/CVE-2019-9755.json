  "details": [
    "\nAn integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.\n    "

  "statement": "\nThis flaw has a lower impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux because the ntfs-3g tool is run in a supermin appliance, which is similar to a virtual machine instantiated on the fly, and it does not have the SUID bit set. Thus an attacker is very limited on what he can do to the vulnerable system.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8: \nThis vulnerability is currently targeted to be addressed in an upcoming release.\n    ",
