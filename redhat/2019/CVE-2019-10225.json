    "\nA flaw was found in atomic-openshift where the basic-user RABC role in OpenShift Container Platform doesn't sufficiently protect the GlusterFS StorageClass against leaking of the restuserkey. An attacker with basic-user permissions is able to edit a GlusterFS StorageClass, obtain the value of restuserkey, and use it to authenticate to the GlusterFS REST service, gaining access to read, and modify files.\n    "

  "mitigation": "\nUse of the restuserkey in GlusterFS StorageClass is deprecated upstream [1] and will be removed in a future release. To mitigate this vulnerability make use of secretName, and secretNamespace parameters to store the Gluster REST service password. \n[1] https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#glusterfs\n    ",
