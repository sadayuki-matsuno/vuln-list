    "\nThe do_hidp_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.15 allows a local user to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a HIDPCONNADD command, because a name field may not end with a '\\0' character.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP). A local attacker with access permissions to the Bluetooth device can issue an IOCTL which will trigger the do_hidp_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c.c. This function can leak potentially sensitive information from the kernel stack memory via a HIDPCONNADD command because a name field may not be correctly NULL terminated.\n    "
