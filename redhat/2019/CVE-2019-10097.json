    "\nA vulnerability was discovered in Apache httpd, in mod_remoteip. A trusted proxy using the \"PROXY\" protocol could send specially crafted headers that can cause httpd to experience a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash or other potential consequences.\n\nThis issue could only be exploited by configured trusted intermediate proxy servers. HTTP clients such as browsers could not exploit the vulnerability.\n    "
