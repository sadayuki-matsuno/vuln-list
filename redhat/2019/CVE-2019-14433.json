    "\nAn issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 17.0.12, 18.x before 18.2.2, and 19.x before 19.0.2. If an API request from an authenticated user ends in a fault condition due to an external exception, details of the underlying environment may be leaked in the response, and could include sensitive configuration or other data.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in the Nova Compute resource fault handling. The Nova Compute service might leak configuration information or other sensitive information because of a failed API request. To trigger this vulnerability, the API request needs to fail due to an external exception. The ability of an attacker to trigger an external exception in another component will determine the success of this attack.\n    "
