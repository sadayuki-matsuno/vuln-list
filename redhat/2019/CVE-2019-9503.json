    "\nIf the brcmfmac driver receives a firmware event frame from a remote source, the is_wlc_event_frame function will cause this frame to be discarded and not be processed. If the driver receives the firmware event frame from the host, the appropriate handler is called. This frame validation can be bypassed if the bus used is USB (for instance by a WiFi dongle). This can allow firmware event frames from a remote source to be processed and this can result in denial of service (DoS) condition.\n    "
