  "details": [
    "\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, drivers/block/floppy.c allows a denial of service by setup_format_params division-by-zero. Two consecutive ioctls can trigger the bug: the first one should set the drive geometry with .sect and .rate values that make F_SECT_PER_TRACK be zero. Next, the floppy format operation should be called. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user even when a floppy disk has not been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s floppy disk driver implementation.  A local attacker with access to the floppy disk device file (/dev/fd0 through to /dev/fdN) can create a situation that causes the kernel to divide by zero. This requires two consecutive ioctl calls to be issued. The first ioctl call sets the sector and rate values, and the second ioctl is the call to format the floppy disk to the appropriate values. This flaw can cause the system to divide by zero and panic the host. No media (floppy) is required to be inserted for this attack to work properly.\n    "

  "mitigation": "\nThe kernel module named 'floppy' contains the affected code, this can be blacklisted using the standard blacklisting techniques or disabled in the systems BIOS.  See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for how to blacklist a kernel module.\n\nVirtualized guest systems can also remove the system from the guests configuration to ensure that the module does not load.\n    ",
