    "\nA stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it writes PNM images due to a misplaced strncpy and off-by-one errors. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images or write PNM images may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or potentially execute code.\n    "
