  "details": [
    "\nIn the seccomp implementation prior to kernel version 4.8, there is a possible seccomp bypass due to seccomp policies that allow the use of ptrace. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-119769499\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's seccomp implementation which contained a method to bypass seccomp syscall filtering policies that allowed ptrace. This could allow an attacker with code execution privileges within the sandbox to use ptrace to execute systemcalls that would be filtered by the policy.\n    "
