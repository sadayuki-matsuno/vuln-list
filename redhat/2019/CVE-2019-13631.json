    "\nIn parse_hid_report_descriptor in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.1, a malicious USB device can send an HID report that triggers an out-of-bounds write during generation of debugging messages.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of GTCO tablet/digitizer's version of the parse_hid_report_descriptor in drivers. An attacker with local access could use this flaw to create a specially crafted USB device inserted into the host to corrupt memory, trigger an out-of-bounds write during the generation of debugging messages, or possibly escalate the privileges of a process.\n    "
