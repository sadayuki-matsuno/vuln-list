  "details": [
    "\nAfter user deletion in MongoDB Server the improper invalidation of authorization sessions allows an authenticated user's session to persist and become conflated with new accounts, if those accounts reuse the names of deleted ones. This issue affects: MongoDB Inc. MongoDB Server v4.0 versions prior to 4.0.9; v3.6 versions prior to 3.6.13; v3.4 versions prior to 3.4.22.\n    ",
    "\nA session expiration flaw was discovered in MongoDB. After a user is deleted, the session tokens for that user do not expire and can be reused if a new user is created with the same name. An attacker with access to a MongoDB user could exploit this flaw to gain access to the new user account.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by either of two administrative practices:\n\n* Whenever a user is deleted, restart all nodes where that user may have an active session\n* When a user is deleted, ensure than a new user with the same name will never be created\n\nIf your mongodb instance is deployed in a situation where users never need to be deleted, or one of the above mitigations can be applied, this vulnerability can not be exploited.\n    ",
