    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel, prior to version 5.0.7, in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c, where a NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas_create_frame_pool() fails in megasas_alloc_cmds().  An attacker can crash the system if they were able to load the megaraid_sas kernel module and groom memory beforehand, leading to a denial of service (DoS), related to a use-after-free.\n    "
