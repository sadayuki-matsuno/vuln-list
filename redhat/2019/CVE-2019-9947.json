  "details": [
    "\nAn issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.\n    "
