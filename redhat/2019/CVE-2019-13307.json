    "\nA heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it parses images when using the evaluate-sequence option. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images and use the evaluate-sequence option or function EvaluateImages may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or potentially execute code.\n    "
