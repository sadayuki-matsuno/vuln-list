    "\nAn assertion failure was found in the way bind implemented the \"managed keys\" feature. An attacker could use this flaw to cause the named daemon to crash. This flaw is very difficult for an attacker to trigger because it requires an operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker.\n    "
