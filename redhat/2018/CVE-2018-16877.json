The attacker needs to have access to the cluster node running pacemaker (AV:L). The attacker can use easily use the design flaw via the confused deputy problem to run the exploit (AC:L), also needs to have login access to the pacemaker node to run the exploit (PR:L). \n\nDue to the elevated privileges obtained, there is an impact to the system beyond the pacemaker node itself (S:C). Lastly due to the attacker's ability to run arbitrary code as root, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system is affected. (CIA:H)\n    ",
