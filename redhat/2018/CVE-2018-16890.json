    "\nlibcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.\n    ",
    "\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way curl handled NTLMv2 type-2 headers. When connecting to a remote malicious server which uses NTLM authentication, the flaw could cause curl to crash.\n    "
